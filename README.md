PressStart is a social platform for gamers and content creators to connect and build their following. This app allows users to signup/login through Devise, upload images with Paperclip & AWS s3, make posts/comments, follow/unfollow other users, and chat in real time using Websockets/Action Cable and Redis.

My backlog includes adding key features for more content curation through different API's and more features within the social aspect as well.

Keep updated with my project as I will continue to add features over time!
